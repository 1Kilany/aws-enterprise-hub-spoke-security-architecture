# AWS Enterprise Hub-and-Spoke Security Architecture

Enterprise-grade AWS networking project implementing a secure Hub-and-Spoke architecture using multiple AWS networking and security services.

---

# Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a highly available, scalable, and secure enterprise AWS network architecture.

The solution centralizes ingress traffic through a Hub VPC while hosting workloads inside a separate Spoke VPC.

Traffic is protected using AWS WAF, inspected through AWS Network Firewall, routed by AWS Transit Gateway, and distributed using both Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB).
